Sales Activity Logging System – Productivity Tracking & Data Standardization

Overview
This project improves daily sales activity tracking by simplifying input structure and streamlining data consolidation across multiple agents. It reduces duplicate data entry, improves reporting accuracy, and saves hours of manual work each week.

The Problem
Before this solution, the daily productivity log had too many columns and repetitive dropdowns. Input fields duplicated information already included in the same row, which slowed agents down and caused inconsistent reporting.

Additionally, a “master file” required manually copying all agents’ logs every day — a backlog that left the full dataset months behind and prevented timely insights.

The Solution
I redesigned the logging system to:
• Minimize columns and remove repetitive data entry
• Standardize dropdowns and data validation rules
• Structure the table for reliable pivot-based reporting
• Create a single consolidated log for daily uploads
• Define naming and version control rules for consistency

Impact
• Reduced time spent logging each day by ~20%
• Eliminated duplicate dropdown selections
• Materially reduced reporting errors
• Improved data quality to enable weekly insights instead of months-late views

Technical Highlights
• Excel Tables + structured references
• Data validation + dropdown optimization
• Pivot Table–ready data architecture
• Process design for multi-agent consolidation
• Documentation for scalability

Future Enhancements
• Automated data consolidation via Power Query or Power Automate
• Integration with Salesforce or other CRM systems
• Visual dashboard for real-time performance tracking
